# Hello world, I'm Josephine ‚ú®

Since I was little, I've had a keen interest in dissecting video games and figuring out how things behind the scenes worked; taking computer science classes peaked my interest in understanding the backend of technology. As an artist, I find joy in crafting and creating, which lead to interest in the creative design aspects in front-end web development and in game development. <br>

I carried this passion to my education at University of Illinois at Chicago where I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in computer science. I currently work as a part-time IT service analyst. Previously, I participated in After School Matters in team programming projects and game design. I have also previously worked as an intern, designing a website for small companies. I enjoy collaborating with others where we can all express our ideas in a safe environment and empowering their ideas to further resolve technical problems in a timely manner. <br>

I look forward to developing my skills as a full-stack web dev and game dev, focusing on software engineering and creative technology. As I learn more about web and game design, I want to bring my skills to Chicago-based companies that is dedicated to software and creative development that will lead a positive impact on society. <br> <br>
